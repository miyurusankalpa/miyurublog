I use a couple of IPv6 only VPS and I though to document them and some others together.

Here *IPv6 only* means,
 - Native IPv6.
 - No NAT IPv4 or NAT64.
 - Removing IPv4 or NAT64 should reduce cost.

### Honourable mentions
 
Following 2 providers were not in the original list due to providing Free NAT64, but due the immense support those 2 providers give to the IPv6 community, I will add them mention below.

* ipv6onlyhosting.com* - 1 shared vCPU, 1GB RAM, 10GB SSD - ~$3.75
* mythic-beasts* -  VPS 1 - 1 shared vCPU, 1GB RAM, 5GB SSD - ~$5.91
 
Note: * Means I have not tried the providers.
