# Why IPv6 Deserves Better Treatment from Hosting Providers

Most server providers treat IPv6 the same way they treat IPv4. On the surface, that might seem fair—but in practice, it’s far from ideal.

IPv4 addresses have become irregular, expensive, and severely limited. IPv6 was created to solve these very problems. Yet, many providers continue to use old habits instead of embracing IPv6’s strengths.

## The Problem with IPv4

IPv4 space has already run out. To cope, server providers now recycle addresses, rely on NAT (Network Address Translation), or sell IPv6 address at a high cost. These workarounds lead to several issues:

* Unpredictable IP allocations
* Poor routing hygiene
* Higher risk of bad IP reputation
* Making VPS prices higher

## Why IPv6 Deserves a Different Approach

IPv6 was designed to be scalable, efficient, and clean. It offers an enormous address space and better routing capabilities. But many providers still treat it like just another version of IPv4—limiting its potential.

To deliver a truly modern and reliable IPv6 experience, providers should rethink how they allocate and manage IPv6. Here’s how:


### 1. Allocate Subnets per Account

Instead of assigning random single IPv6 addresses, providers should allocate a IPv6 subnet per customer account and give customer the flexibility to design their own IP structure.

Benefits include:

* Better organization
* Easier service isolation
* Room for scaling and growth

### 2. Allow Users to Bring Their Own IPv6 Prefixes

Advanced users should have the option to bring their own IPv6 address blocks (known as BYOIP—Bring Your Own IP). This unlocks several advantages:

* Full control over IP reputation
* Easier migration between providers
* Consistent firewall rules and network architecture

### 3. Simplify Routing and Firewalls

With clear subnet boundaries and the ability to bring your own IP space, users can build more secure and efficient networks:

* Cleaner firewall configurations
* Better route filtering
* Fewer IP conflicts across services

### 4. Protect IPv6 Reputation

On shared IPv6 prefixes, one bad actor can damage the reputation of the entire block—impacting all users. With dedicated subnets or user-owned prefixes, reputation problems are isolated to individual accounts.

This is especially critical for services like:

* Email delivery
* Public APIs
* Web hosting

## Final Thoughts

IPv6 is the future, but only if we stop applying outdated IPv4 practices to it. Hosting providers need to start building IPv6 services that are scalable, secure, and user-friendly.

So far, AWS is one of the few major providers deploying IPv6 with this modern mindset—offering subnet-level control and support for user-owned prefixes.

Let’s hope others follow soon.
